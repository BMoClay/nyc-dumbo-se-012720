# Hashketball Review

## How to lectures with Graham
+ Participation
+ Recording
+ Breaks
+ Should I code along?
+ Falling asleep
+ Question-asking hours

## Key Questions
* What's cool about `rspec --fail-fast`?
* How can I tell an array from a hash in ruby?
* How should I handle an array differently than a hash in ruby?
* If I forget what I can do with an array or a hash in ruby, what should I do?

* When should I use this method (what does the method do)?
* What can I call this method on? 
* What does this method return? 
* What do I put in the block?

  * `#map`
    * Do a thing (a transformation) to each element in the array, and return an array of transformed elements
  * `#select`
    * Looks through the array and returns a smaller array based on what's in the block
  * `#find`
    * Looks through the array and finds an element based on the return value of the block

  * `#each`
* What is the Single Responsibility Principle?
* How can I use the tests to guide me through the labs with maximum learning?
  * What is Red, Green, Refactor, and how can I use that process?

Make it work (shameless green), make it right, make it fast.
